## Usage

To use this Anime Recommendation App, you can get suggestions by clicking on one of the five genre buttons to see what popular animes show up in the TV and Movie sections. Two APIs will be used which are fetched from the apiFunctions.js file. The information will be displayed dynamically on the homepage, which will be structured and styled with Bootstrap and a custom CSS style sheet. 

## Roadmap

- Create modals to display more information for the anime titles instead of having to go to another website in a new tab.
- Find ways to make the hero image load faster. 
- Developing a random function to supply quotes.
- Make a Nav bar for the header section with a logo.
- Fully develop branding.
- Develop a way to facilitate user feedback and/or support.
- Add a carousel to the hero section to choose from five anime titles.
